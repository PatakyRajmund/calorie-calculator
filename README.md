# Calorie Counter
**The project includes a website that is capable of calculating the needed daily calorie intake for your weight goal based on your height, gender, age, weight and activity level. It calculates everything on device (with JS).**

The website is _mostly_ responsive (handles different screen sizes appropriately), and has limited validation for input data (uses HTMLs built in solution to tell what type of data one expects).
For the calculations it uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to calculate the BMR and multiplies it with the person's activity level multiplier to get the TDEE. It corrects the daily required calorie intake based on the individual's estimated weight for the current week.

## Motivation
I have spent a **lot of** time with trying to find a website that could calculate required calorie intakes for weight gain with little to no success, so I decided to make my own.
